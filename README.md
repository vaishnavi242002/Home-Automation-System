# Home Automation System

## Overview
The **Home Automation System** project leverages **Arduino UNO** and the **Blynk platform** to create a smart home solution that allows users to control lighting, monitor temperature, and manage water levels remotely. The project showcases the integration of various sensors and actuators to enhance convenience and efficiency in home management.

## Features
- **Remote Lighting Control**: Adjust brightness and control lights using the Blynk app.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Monitor ambient temperature in real-time and receive notifications when it exceeds a certain threshold.
- **Water Level Management**: Monitor water levels in a tank and automate the opening/closing of valves based on the water level.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily control and monitor devices through the Blynk mobile application.
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Instant feedback on system status through the LCD and Blynk app notifications.

## Technologies Used
- **Arduino UNO**: The microcontroller used for implementing the system.
- **Embedded C**: The programming language used for coding the firmware.
- **Blynk Platform**: A cloud-based IoT platform that provides a user-friendly interface for remote control.
- **Ethernet Communication**: Enables connectivity between the Arduino and the Blynk cloud for real-time data exchange.
- **LiquidCrystal_I2C Library**: Used for interfacing with the LCD display.
- **Sensors**:
  - **Temperature Sensor**: Monitors ambient temperature.
  - **LDR Module**: Measures light intensity for lighting control.
  - **Water Level Sensor**: Monitors the water level in the tank.
- **Actuators**:
  - **Relays**: Controls high-voltage devices like heaters and pumps.
